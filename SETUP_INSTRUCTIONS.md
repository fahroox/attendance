# Design Studio Attendance System - Setup Instructions

## üéâ What's Been Implemented

Your attendance system foundation is now ready! Here's what has been built:

### ‚úÖ Authentication System
- **Sign Up**: Users can register with email/password and select their role (Admin or Team)
- **Login**: Secure authentication with role-based redirects
- **Password Reset**: Forgot password functionality with email reset links
- **Session Management**: Secure cookie-based sessions

### ‚úÖ Role-Based Access Control
- **Admin Dashboard**: `/admin/dashboard` - For studio administrators
- **Team Dashboard**: `/team/dashboard` - For team members
- **Middleware Protection**: Admin routes are protected from non-admin users
- **Automatic Redirects**: Users are redirected to appropriate dashboards based on their role

### ‚úÖ Database Schema
- **User Profiles Table**: Stores user information and roles
- **Row-Level Security**: Secure data access policies
- **Automatic Profile Creation**: Profiles are created automatically on signup

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Supabase
1. Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-setup.sql` and execute it
4. Note your project URL and anon key from Settings > API

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_OR_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 3. Run the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Test the System
1. Visit `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "Get Started" to sign up
3. Create an admin account and a team account
4. Test login/logout functionality
5. Verify role-based access (try accessing `/admin/dashboard` with a team account)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tips

1. **Database Changes**: Always test SQL changes in a development environment first
2. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env.local` to version control
3. **Role Testing**: Create test accounts with both admin and team roles
4. **Security**: Review Supabase RLS policies regularly
5. **Deployment**: Use the Vercel + Supabase integration for easy deployment
